[Intro: Polo G]
Uh, uh, uh (Southside on the track), uh-uh, uh (Mello made it right), uh

[Chorus: Polo G]
New drip, I just spent some Gs on my attire
These racks just keep on growin', but my jeans gettin' tighter, uh
I went overseas with the swiper
Bad bitch, no, I never seen nothin' like her, uh
I bought Glocks with beams for my snipers
Any sudden movement, make it sing like the choir
R.I.P., that chrome sprayin', got Lindsey Lohan
I need some more bands, bitch, I'm a grown man, uh
[Verse: Polo G]
If you gon' tweet, it ain't no need to tell me how you feel
My whole city catching Bs, I'm from the 'Raq, for real
Broski turn into a demon when he off them pills
Ride 'til I die, I hope that Jesus come and grab the wheel
Uh, uh, that chopper singin' like Clay Aiken, uh
R.I.P. to all my loved ones that ain't make it, uh
Got a bond with the streets and I just can't break it
Run it up, now my safe done turned into my safe haven
Them racks in, okay, okay
On the block, I post up, I can't fade away
Baby, I been too turnt, I don't care 'bout what a hater say
Dark skin, thick bitch, I liked her, so I named her, "Bae"
I'm in it everyday, uh

[Chorus: Polo G]
New drip, I just spent some Gs on my attire
These racks just keep on growin', but my jeans gettin' tighter, uh
I went overseas with the swiper
Bad bitch, no, I never seen nothin' like her, uh
I bought Glocks with beams for my snipers
Any sudden movement, make it sing like the choir
R.I.P., that chrome sprayin', got Lindsey Lohan
I need some more bands, bitch, I'm a grown man, uh (I'm a grown man, uh)

[Outro: Polo G]
(R.I.P., that chrome sprayin', got Lindsey Lohan)
(I need some more bands, bitch, I'm a grown man, uh)
